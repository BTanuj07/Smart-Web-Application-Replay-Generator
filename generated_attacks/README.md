# AttackReplay Pro - Generated Attack Scripts

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**These scripts are for authorized security testing only!**

- Only use on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test
- Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical
- Always follow responsible disclosure practices
- Use these tools to improve security, not to cause harm

## 📁 Generated Files

This directory contains 2 attack simulation scripts based on detected threats:

### Individual Attack Scripts
- `attack_01_Directory_Traversal.py` - Directory Traversal attack simulation
- `attack_02_Local_File_Inclusion.py` - Local File Inclusion attack simulation

### Batch Attack Script
- `batch_attack_all.py` - Run all attacks in sequence

### Shell Scripts (curl)
- `attack_*.sh` - Curl-based attack scripts for each detected threat

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Target
Edit the scripts and change the target URL:
```python
TARGET_URL = "http://your-target-website.com"  # Change this!
```

### 2. Run Individual Attacks
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x attack_01_SQL_Injection.py

# Run the attack
python3 attack_01_SQL_Injection.py
```

### 3. Run All Attacks (Batch)
```bash
# Run all attacks in sequence
python3 batch_attack_all.py
```

### 4. Using Curl Scripts
```bash
# Run curl-based attack
./attack_01_SQL_Injection.sh
```

## 📊 Attack Summary

Total attacks detected: **2**

Attack breakdown:
- **Directory Traversal**: 1 attack(s)
- **Local File Inclusion**: 1 attack(s)


## 🔧 Script Features

### Advanced Python Scripts
- **Realistic simulation**: Mimics real attack behavior
- **Vulnerability detection**: Analyzes responses for indicators
- **Multiple attempts**: Can run multiple attack variations
- **Detailed reporting**: Shows response analysis and timing
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of network issues
- **Random delays**: Avoids detection by security systems

### Enhanced Curl Scripts
- **Target URL variables**: Easy to change target
- **Comprehensive headers**: Realistic browser simulation
- **Response analysis**: Shows status, timing, and size
- **SSL handling**: Ignores certificate errors for testing

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Testing SQL Injection
```bash
python3 attack_01_SQL_Injection.py
```
This will:
1. Connect to your target website
2. Execute the SQL injection payload
3. Analyze the response for vulnerability indicators
4. Report findings with detailed analysis

### Batch Testing
```bash
python3 batch_attack_all.py
```
This will:
1. Run all detected attacks in sequence
2. Add random delays between attacks
3. Provide a comprehensive summary report
4. Show success/failure rates

## 🛡️ Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Get Permission**: Always get written authorization before testing
2. **Test Safely**: Use isolated test environments when possible
3. **Monitor Impact**: Watch for service disruption during testing
4. **Document Findings**: Keep detailed records of vulnerabilities found
5. **Report Responsibly**: Follow responsible disclosure practices
6. **Fix Issues**: Prioritize fixing found vulnerabilities

## 🔍 Understanding Results

### Vulnerability Indicators
The scripts look for common vulnerability indicators:

- **SQL Injection**: Database error messages, syntax errors
- **XSS**: Script execution, alert dialogs
- **Directory Traversal**: System file contents
- **Command Injection**: System command output
- **Error Disclosure**: Stack traces, debug information

### Response Analysis
Each script provides:
- HTTP status codes
- Response timing
- Content length
- Response headers
- Content preview
- Vulnerability indicators
